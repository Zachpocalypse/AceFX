# AceFX
Ace based standalone code editor in JavaFX with automated syntax highlighting and lots of themes.

## Description

It uses [Ace-Builds](https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace-builds/) as the source to get ace and [src-min-noconflict](resources/src-noconflict) as the ace.js source.   

AceFX Editor supports almost all of the methods that original Ace Editor has. It extends the Ace editor to use in JavaFX in a way that you won't notice any difference between it and any other normal code editor. 

## To DO    

 * GetThemeList()   
 * GetLanguageList()
 * Identify file type by extension in OpenFile()
 * Make a toolbar   
 * Add events
